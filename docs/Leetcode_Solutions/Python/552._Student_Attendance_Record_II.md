> 内容描述

```
Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.

A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following three characters:

'A' : Absent.
'L' : Late.
'P' : Present.
A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 8 
Explanation:
There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
"PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent times. 
Note: The value of n won't exceed 100,000.

自己的精华总结

```
- dp[i+1] means the number of all possible attendance (without 'A') records with length i 
- then we can get dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3], we can think of this way, dp[i] can end with 'P' or 'L', then
dp[i] = dp[i].endwith('P') + dp[i].endwith('L')
      = dp[i].endwith('P') + dp[i].endwith('PL') + dp[i].endwith('LL')
      = dp[i].endwith('P') + dp[i].endwith('PL') + dp[i].endwith('PLL') + dp[i].endwith('LLL')

but we know that dp[i].endwith('LLL') is not allowed, 
so dp[i] = dp[i].endwith('P') + dp[i].endwith('PL') + dp[i].endwith('PLL')
         = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]
     
because we can simply regard dp[i].endwith('P') as dp[i-1] + 'P', so the number of all possible attendance equals to dp[i-1],
similarly, dp[i].endwith('PL') = dp[i-2] and dp[i].endwith('PLL') = dp[i-3]


then the number of all possible attendance (with 'A') records with length n is:
sum(dp[i+1] * dp[n-i] i = 0,1,...,n)

why sum(dp[i+1] * dp[n-i] i = 0,1,...,n)? 
- because we can now insert one 'A' at any point , so the 'A' can be at index of 0,1,2,...,n-1
- or we don't have an 'A', which means 'A' is at the index of n, which is not included in the final string
     
For n = 3, there are totally 4 ways to represent all possible attendance:
1. dp[1] 'A' dp[3]
2. dp[2] 'A' dp[2]
2. dp[3] 'A' dp[1]
2. dp[4] without 'A'


```

    def checkRecord(self, n):

        if n == 1:
            return 3
        dp = [1, 1, 2]
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp.append((dp[i] + dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % M)
        res = 0
        for i in range(n+1):
            res += (dp[i+1] * dp[(n+1) - 1 - i]) % M # i 代表 'A' 前面的长度，(n+1) - 1 - i 代表 'A' 后面的长度
            res %= M
        return res
